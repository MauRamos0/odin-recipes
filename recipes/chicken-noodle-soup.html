        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Onions and Celery: </strong>In the first step of
                    this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and chopped
                    celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and
                    tender.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Broth: </strong>This chicken noodle soup recipe
                    calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If
                    you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or
                    the other.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Chicken: </strong>Of course, you'll need chicken. If
                    you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in
                    place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly
                    shortcut.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Noodles: </strong>Make sure you don't add the
                    noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them
                    mushy.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Carrots: </strong>Carrots, which add a pop of bright
                    color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they
                    stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed vegetables at
                    the beginning if you like your carrots tender.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Basil and Oregano: </strong>Dried basil and oregano
                    lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.
                </p>
